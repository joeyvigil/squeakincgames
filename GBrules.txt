GAMPLAY 
OVERVIEW

Player Turn
	Starting from first player to last going clockwise, all players take one turn. On a player’s turn, players play a card from their hand and discard it into their personal discard. 

Each Round
After all player have taken their turn, do the following:
1. Advance Technology Track: Discard the rightmost technology card from the track and shift all remaining cards to the right. Then, replenish the track by adding a new technology card. 
2. Gain/Pay ₡ based on the income tracker. Example: if your income is at +8, then gain 8 ₡oins from the bank. If your income is at -3, then pay 3 ₡oins to the bank (if you can).
3. Rotate 1st player marker clockwise, 1st player starts their turn.

Game End
Game ends immediately after the last technology card is purchased or discarded.
Winner is determined by who has the most Victory Points (VPs). (see scoring section)

Example of play
	Starting from first player to last going clockwise, all players take one turn. On a player’s turn, players play a card from their hand and discard it into their personal discard. 



























CARDS

Loan
	After playing a Loan card, adjust your income marker and gain ₡oins accordingly. Example: when playing the starter Loan card, a player may choose to ‘Trade 2 income for 30 ₡oins,’ moving their income marker from 0 to -2 and receiving 30 ₡ from the bank.


Trade
	Player may buy/sell up to two types of goods with the bank in any amount. Example: Player plays a starter trade card and sells 4 food and buys 2 iron for a total cost of 10₡. Math: (+4x5₡ - 2x15₡ = -10₡). 
Maximum Coins: The maximum coins a player can ever have is 300. Any excess must be returned to maintain this limit. 
Unlimited Resources: Resources are not limited.  If the bank runs out, then players can place a resource cube on a money token to signify that amount such as place a food cube on a 10 ₡ coin to signify 10 food.

Production
	Players first receive resources from the bank and/or lab as indicated on the card. They then choose one province on the map and all cities in that province produce resources, even if they belong to another player. Example: Player plays a starter production card, receives a gold resource that was located in the lab, then chooses Drakewood.  That player has a city built on a food, gold, and iron token in that province and another player has a city built on a wood token. Both players gets their corresponding resources.

Reset
	Player places cards from their discard into their hand. Example: Player plays a starter reset card. That player places the top 5 cards of their discard into their hand. Note: the starter reset will always remain in your hand. Note: you can retrive less than the max amount.

Treachery
	Players may steal resources, buy resources for a low cost, or take the actions of cards from other players.
Development
	Player can purchase technology cards with resources going to the lab. Place the acquired cards in your hand. Example: Player plays their starter development card. They choose to purchase a green build card on the +0₡ location and a purple loan card on the +5₡ location. The total cost is (iron + gold + 0₡) + (10₡ + food + 5₡). The iron, gold and food go to the lab which is located below the technology deck, the coins go to the bank. After the purchase(s), all remaining technology cards inside the track move to the right if their right position is empty, and the track is replenished.

Build
1. Choose a token adjacent to one of your cities.
Adjacent Definition- Connected by a road.
2. Pay the build cost based on the city type:
--- = 20 ₡
--- =   --- + 10 ₡
--- = --- + ---     
--- = --- + 5 ₡
--- = --- + 10 ₡

3. Place a city on that token. 
4. Gain the designated income.

	Example: Player plays a starter build card. Player looks at all cities adjacent to their current cities and decides to place it on a gold production token. They then pay the build cost of 1 coal and 10 ₡ and place one of their cities on that token. They then gain 3 income as indicated on the card, sliding their income tracking  disk.

Overbuilding: Players may also build on a location where there is already a city, with an additional cost. Example: A coal city resource token has another player built on it. Player can still build on the resource token for an additional 10₡. The total build cost for this would be 1 food, 1 wood and 10₡. Players may overbuild on their own cities.

SCORING

The top of most cards contains tags that look like the following:
Tje




Players receive VPs based off of the tags they have at the end of the game in their hand and discard.

Victory Points
Show side of board with victory point cards.


Pink Tags: Consistency
VPs = # --- x6
Pink tags grant six VPs each. Example: 2 pink cards yield 12 VPs.

Purple Tags: Wealth
VPs = # --- x (₡oins at end / 20)
Purple tags award points based on leftover coins divided by 20 (rounded down). Example: 2 purple tags and 110 ₡ result in 10 VPs.

Yellow Tags: Empire
VPs = # --- x cities
Yellow tags provide points for the player’s total cities. Example: 3 yellow tags and 7 cities yield 21 VPs.

Blue Tags: Abundance
VPs = # --- x city resource production types x2
Blue tags gives points for cities built on different production types. Example: Player has 2 food cities, 3 coal cities and 1 gold city. This would be three production types (food, coal, gold). This would give 2x3=6 VPs per blue tag.

Red Tags: Dominance
VPs = # --- x provinces with most cities x3
Red tags award points for having the most cities in a province.

Green Tags: Scattered
VPs = # --- x provinces with at least 1 city x2
Green tags score points for each province with at least one city.












Example: Blue player, with 6 cities, scores 6 points per yellow tag, 8 VP per blue tag (with 4 production types), 6 VP per red tag (having the most cities in Dragonspire and Faeloria), and 8 VP per green tag (having at least 1 city in Misthaven, Dragonspire, Goldendale, and Faeloria).
