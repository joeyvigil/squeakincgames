            <h3>Failed Kickstarter and Plans for a Relaunch</h3>
            <p>
              I initiated a Kickstarter campaign with an ambitious goal of $49,000, but the experience revealed areas that still require refinement in Gorbino's Quest. Looking ahead, I am considering a relaunch, tentatively scheduled for January, with a more modest funding target. The plan is to distribute additional copies through platforms such as Amazon or other board game websites. Despite the challenges encountered during the board game development process, I remain committed to the project. Recently, a new game concept, tentatively titled <strong>Spirit Bath House</strong>, took shape. Inspired by the bathhouse in Spirited Away, this game will feature worker placement mechanics with influences from Viticulture and Caylus. Players will be tasked with giving the correct baths to spirits, potentially involving the creation of specific bath tokens using various resources. Additionally, the game will incorporate the construction of buildings that other players can utilize, akin to Caylus. One of the primary actions will involve fulfilling orders with bath tokens, resembling the mechanics found in Viticulture. While I'm enthusiastic about this new idea, I plan to keep it on the back burner until Gorbino's Quest reaches completion.

                <h3>Acquiring Artistic Brilliance</h3>
                <p>
                  To breathe life into Gorbino's Quest, I scoured Reddit's Starving Artist forum, a haven for creative minds. Initially drawn to the enchanting watercolors of Shawnasaur (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shawnasaur/">Instagram</a>), budget constraints led me to discover the exceptional talents of Amanda Corona (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sanagie/">Instagram</a>)  and Artistic Yomii (<a href="https://afkyomii.artstation.com/">ArtStation</a>). Over a few weeks, these artists masterfully crafted 48 pieces of art, bringing the game to life.

                <h3>Crafting Card Perfection</h3>
                <p>
                  PandaGM recommended Adobe InDesign for finalizing card files. Despite a fleeting attempt to circumvent Adobe's subscription fees, I ultimately succumbed and subscribed for a brief period. InDesign proved to be an intuitive and enjoyable tool, culminating in a satisfying design for all the cards. Here's a glimpse of one:

                <h3>Charting the Course Ahead</h3>
                <p>
                  As I prepare for the Kickstarter launch, a 'ToDo' list becomes my guiding star. Here's a snapshot of the essential tasks:

              20: Took pictures of women with my 35mm camera all day, looked at backpacks since the strap on mine broke, tried to play pool with some random, some gypsies tried to sell me a (lady), saw some girls I met in Vienna (Mia and Isabella) went to a German bar, met a girl and two guys, played chess with one of them, he had his own board and I lost,  girl wrote “do you want me to get them to leave?” On a piece of paper. Two more (ladies) tried to get with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              21: Walked around around the city and took photos during the day. Ate cheaply. Didn’t drink because I had so much the night before.
            </p>
            <p>
              22: Went to cafe_Analóg and developed my 3 rolls of film. At night drank with like 3 groups of people in the ruins bar. At the end of the night they started kissing and I felt singled out, lonely and depressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              23: Didn’t feel like doing anything but my roommates invited me to the hot baths. It was super relaxing. Switching between the hottest and coldest bath felt great. Went to the rooftop bath and fell asleep in it. Breathtaking view. Afterwards we went to a fancy restaurant.

              or... how I designed this website in less than a week
            </p>

            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>
              Before diving into the development process, ensure you have a GitHub account for version control and a domain registration account with a service like Google Domains or GoDaddy.
            </p>

            <h3>Essential Tools</h3>
            <p>
              Make use of GitHub Desktop, a vital tool that simplifies tasks such as pushing, pulling, and committing code changes. For code editing, leverage the capabilities of Visual Studio Code (VScode).
            </p>

            <h3>Simplified Workflow</h3>
            <p>
              Here's an overview of the steps involved in creating the website without delving too deep into each one.
              <ol>
                <li>Select a Bootstrap Template: Begin by obtaining a Twitter Bootstrap template. I personally chose one from <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/">bootstrapmade.com</a>, but you can find numerous options by searching "bootstrap templates" or "twitter bootstrap templates." Opt for a template with a theme similar to what you have in mind. This template will serve as your starting point.</li>
                <li>Create a Github Repository and clone it using Github Desktop. I used Github Desktops default location which was in documents folder.</li>
                <li>Copy the template you downloaded to the base of the repo you just cloned.</li>
                <li>Commit and push to origin using Github Desktop. Your website will now be saved to github. This may take a few minutes to take effect.</li>
                <li>On github.com, click on your repo, go to settings >> Pages >> change your Source to main. It will now give a link to you site (example: https://joeyvigil.github.io/squeakincgames/). <a href="https://youtu.be/DqjPr7auwdY?si=62xTpP5oU93ehlAW">Video tutorial of this step</a> </li>
                <li>Purchase a domain through a domain service like Google Domains or GoDaddy. Configure the DNS settings accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rKz6kIW4Uos?si=6VUk-cpKBF_znoOW">Video tutorial of this step</a> </li>
                <li>Employ VScode to edit and fine-tune your website. While this phase can be challenging, remember that resources like <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">Chat GPT</a> are available to assist you in generating content if you encounter difficulties. </li>
                <li>Celebrate Your Success: With your website polished and ready, take a moment to celebrate your achievement in developing a functional website in such a short span of time.</li>
              </ol>
              By following this streamlined approach and using the recommended tools, you can efficiently create and deploy a website within a week. Remember that while speed is a priority, maintaining the quality and functionality of your website should not be compromised.
            </p>

            <p>
              Welcome to the realm of Eldoria, a fantastical world where magic and mystery intertwine with the tapestry of reality. In the beginning, there was only the Void, a vast expanse of nothingness. But from the depths of the Void emerged the First Deities, ancient and powerful beings of pure energy and consciousness. These Deities were the architects of creation, and they sought to shape a world of wonder and beauty.
            </p>

            <p>
              The First Deities were three in number:
            </p>

            <h3>Aetharion, the Shaper</h3>
            <p>
              Aetharion possessed the gift of creation and imagination. He shaped the lands, mountains, and oceans. Every landscape was a canvas for his artistic prowess, and his touch brought life and form to the once-empty realm.
            </p>

            <h3>Lunara, the Enchantress</h3>
            <p>
              Lunara was the embodiment of magic and mysticism. She wove the threads of arcane energy throughout Eldoria, infusing it with the power of the elements and the weave of reality itself. Her presence granted the world its inherent magic.
            </p>

            <h3>Thaldir, the Guardian</h3>
            <p>
              Thaldir was the stalwart protector of all living things. He forged the laws of nature and established the balance between life and death. His watchful gaze ensured that harmony reigned within Eldoria.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Together, Aetharion, Lunara, and Thaldir brought the world into existence. Aetharion's creative fervor shaped the continents and landscapes, while Lunara's arcane energy gave birth to the skies, the seas, and the magical currents that flowed through the world. Thaldir's guardianship ensured that life flourished, and death played its role in the eternal cycle.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The First Deities willed it to fill the world with beings to appreciate its beauty and to safeguard its wonders. So, they crafted the mortal races:
            </p>

            <h3>Elvenkind</h3>
            <p>
              Born from the whispers of Lunara's magic, the Elves were bestowed with longevity and an innate connection to the arcane forces. They became scholars and keepers of ancient knowledge.
            </p>
            <!-- <img src="assets/img/blog/blog-inside-post.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""> -->

            <h3>Dwarvenkind</h3>
            <p>
              Forged from the heart of the mountains by Aetharion's careful hands, the Dwarves were blessed with craftsmanship and determination. They mined precious gems and metals, crafting magnificent cities below the earth.
            </p>

            <h3>Humanity</h3>
            <p>
              Thaldir breathed life into the Humans, granting them adaptability and the desire to explore. They settled across the world, forming diverse cultures and societies.
            </p>

            <h3>Goblinkind</h3>
            <p>
              From the mischievous spark of Aetharion's imagination, Goblins emerged as a race of clever and curious beings. Small in stature but big in heart, Goblins possess a natural affinity for invention and ingenuity. Their towns, nestled in the heart of forests and among the roots of towering trees, are bustling hubs of activity where gadgets and contraptions are crafted.
            </p>

            <h3>Orcish</h3>
            <p>
              Orcs, forged in the heat of Thaldir's protective spirit, are a rugged and resilient race. Though often misunderstood as brutish warriors, Orcs are fiercely loyal to their clans and possess a deep connection to the land. They have a unique bond with nature and hold a reverence for the spirits of the earth, often practicing shamanic rituals to communicate with these ancient forces.
            </p>

            <h3>Halflings</h3>
            <p>
              Halflings, born of Lunara's whimsy and Aetharion's warmth, are a small, joyful, and light-hearted race. They embrace life with open hearts and find pleasure in the simple pleasures of good food, music, and camaraderie. Despite their diminutive size, Halflings possess a remarkable courage and an adventurous spirit that often leads them on journeys to discover new lands and cultures.
            </p>

            <p>
              But, as with all tales of creation, there must also be a force of darkness to challenge the light. From the depths of the Void, a shadowy being known as <b>Zarothar</b> emerged. Zarothar rejected the harmony of creation and sought to plunge Eldoria into chaos. A great struggle between the First Deities and Zarothar ensued, resulting in a cataclysmic clash of energies.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                In the end, the First Deities managed to seal Zarothar within a prison of pure magic, bound by the combined strength of Aetharion, Lunara, and Thaldir. But the battle left its scars on the world, giving rise to regions of wild magic and mystical anomalies.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              To this day, the First Deities watch over Eldoria, ensuring that the balance is maintained. The mortal races flourish, discovering ancient artifacts of power left behind by their divine creators. Yet, whispers in the wind speak of Zarothar's impending return, and heroes must rise to protect the realm from the looming darkness.
            </p>

            <p>
              And so, the saga of Eldoria continues, a tale of creation, magic, and the eternal struggle between light and shadow.
            </p>
